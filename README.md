# sign-recognition-ml

This repository implements a sign language recognition system using machine learning. We explore two different methods for classifying hand gestures (digits 0‚Äì9 and letters a‚Äìz) and compare their performance.

## üîç Method 1: Transfer Learning with CNN

In **Method 1**, we leverage a pretrained ResNet152V2 model and fine‚Äëtune it for sign language classification:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 224√ó224 pixels and normalized to [0,1].
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Base: ResNet152V2 (imagenet weights, without top layers)
   - Custom head: BatchNormalization ‚Üí Dense(1024) ‚Üí Dropout ‚Üí Dense(512) ‚Üí Dropout ‚Üí Dense(256) ‚Üí Dropout ‚Üí Dense(36, softmax)
   - L2 regularization and dropout are used to reduce overfitting.
3. **Training & Evaluation**: The model achieves ~80% accuracy on the held-out test set.
4. **Outputs**:
   - Saved model file: `best_sign_lang_finetuned.h5`
   - Training curves and evaluation metrics saved in the notebook.

## üîß Method 2: Alternative Approach (TBD)

Details for the second classification strategy will be added soon.

## üé• Real-Time Sign Recognition Demo

We provide a script to run live inference using your webcam. It:

- Captures frames from the camera.
- Uses MediaPipe to detect and track a single hand.
- Extracts a bounding box around the hand and preprocesses the ROI.
- Feeds the ROI into the fine-tuned model, smooths predictions over a window for stability, and overlays the result on the video.

**Usage**:

1. Place or download the pretrained model (`best_sign_lang_finetuned.h5`).
2. Run the demo notebook or script:
   ```bash
   python realtime_sign_recognition.py
   ```
